        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, 
            he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, 
            World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes 
            on the internet for two decades.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Meat</b>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><b>Onion and garlic</b>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Tomato products</b>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar</b>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Spices and seasonings</b>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Lasagna noodles</b>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><b>Cheeses</b>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><b>Egg</b>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients. </li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons 
                parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
                for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
                8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise 
                over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either 
                spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
        </ol>
