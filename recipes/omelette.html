        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. 
            It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch 
            or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir 
                until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while 
                shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. </li>
            <li>Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelette. </li>
            <li> Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelette.</li>
            <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, 
                about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelette in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
