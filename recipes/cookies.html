        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Butter</b>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. 
                The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><b>Vanilla</b>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li><b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><b>Water</b>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><b>Chocolate chips</b>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            <li><b>Nuts (optional)</b>: Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is softened, and your eggs are room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar 
                with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla. </li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. </li>
            <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts. </li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
